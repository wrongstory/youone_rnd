# Migration Ownership

- Platform/Security is the only concurrent writer of this directory.
- Use one global UTC timestamp prefix and descriptive suffix for every SQL migration.
- A Feature submits table, FK, constraint, index, RLS, audit, and forward-fix requirements; it does not create a competing migration.
- Never edit an applied migration. Corrections are new forward-fix migrations.
- Each business migration enables RLS and deny-first policies with its tables.
- Verify against a clean database and an upgrade fixture before merge.
